# 🛰️ Satellite Mission Control Project – MIMS Lab Version

This repository hosts the full codebase for a **hybrid satellite mission control system** developed at the **Mixed-Reality Immersive Motion Simulation (MIMS) Lab**.

We integrate **Open MCT** (NASA’s mission control software) with a custom **Immersive C2** platform (built using **Unreal Engine**) to simulate and manage **satellite debris collision scenarios** through both 2D and 3D interfaces.

---

## 🌐 Project Objectives

- Visualize satellite orbit and telemetry in **real time**
- Simulate **delta-V (Δv)** maneuvers and debris avoidance
- Develop custom **Open MCT plugins** for mission control UI
- Build an **immersive 3D environment** to enhance spatial awareness
- Create a custom **command terminal** for issuing maneuvers

---

## 🧩 Open MCT Plugins

Custom plugins we developed include:

| Plugin Name        | Functionality                                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TLEPlugin.js`     | Parses TLE data (from file or API) and creates telemetry    |
| `AngleFeedPlugin.js` | Reads real-time satellite angular position from JSON       |
| `OrbitVisualizer`  | Visualizes orbit path relative to Earth in 2D               |
| `CommandWindow`    | Issues commands (burns) and logs responses (custom-built)   |

Open MCT is responsible for:

- Telemetry streaming and plotting
- Dashboard creation and layout editing
- Mission status and health monitoring

---

## 🛰️ Orbit Simulator

To support testable mission control features, we created a lightweight **Python-based orbit simulator** that:

- Simulates circular orbit motion
- Outputs telemetry to JSON (consumed by both Open MCT and Immersive C2)
- Accepts `burn` commands and simulates orbital changes
- Allows safe testing of maneuver logic outside Unreal

---

## 🖥️ Immersive C2 (Unreal Engine)

Immersive C2 (short for Command & Control) visualizes:

- Satellite orbit in 3D around the Earth
- Δv maneuver animations
- Debris proximity and collision warning zones
- Pilot/operator view with cinematic awareness

It polls telemetry (JSON) at runtime and updates the visualization accordingly.

## 🔗 Hybrid Architecture

```
[ Open MCT ]
     ↓ (Command + Plot Telemetry)
[ Shared JSON / Flask API ]
     ↔ Real-time Sync ↔
[ Immersive C2 (Unreal Engine) ]
     ↑ (3D Orbit & Debris Visualizer)
```

> All systems share common telemetry feeds (e.g., `angle_feed.json`) and can be synchronized using a simple JSON API or WebSocket backend.
